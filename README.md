This will be a simple tool which will calculate FTE count based on measured times.
Currently the tool is at a very early stage with only base design ideas available.
In the near future functionalities will be implemented to all buttons and menus.
There will be additional pages attached to the main window.
  - Admin panel from where you can modify the teams, full access to all records.
  - Archive panel from where you can access all measures for a specific process/employee as read only view.

p.s If you find this tool interesting feel free to give suggestions/advices as I am still on my learning journey :)
